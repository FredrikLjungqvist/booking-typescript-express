## Server
To install dependencies, type "npm install" in the server directory
start command is "npm run dev"
The server has a .rest file to test endpoints and a .env file with the PORT infromation. In the repo on github this file is missing. Just create a new .env in the root directory of the server and add "PORT=4000" (without the "") to it
## Client
To install dependencies, type "npm install" in the client directory
start command is "npm start"
You can fetch, create, update and delete Tables in the app. This will change the conten of .json files on the server
You are also given a few "cat facts" everytime you reload the page.
